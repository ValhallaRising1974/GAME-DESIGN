# Valhalla Rising - Dialogue System

This is a simple Python script for managing character dialogues based on situation/context. It reads from a structured `.json` file and returns a random line based on input.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the character name (e.g., Leila, Tuane).
3. Enter the situation (e.g., greeting, combat, teleport).
4. Get a random line matching the character and situation.
