# Devlog #1 – Why I’m Really Doing This  
*March 26, 2025*  

Creating *Valhalla Rising – The Parchment* is not just about building a game.  
It's about healing.  
It's about transforming pain into purpose.  

I've lived through shadows. Trauma. Silence.  
And I chose not to let those things define me — but to shape something meaningful through them.

This project is a way to tell the world that it’s okay to feel lost.  
It’s okay to rebuild.  
It’s okay to not want to follow the scripts that were written by others.  
Because we all have the right to create our own.

Each champion I write is a part of me.  
Each line of code is a breath, a heartbeat, a truth I refuse to silence.

Maybe this won’t change the world.  
But it’s already changing mine.

And if someone, someday, reads this…  
and feels less alone,  
then Valhalla has truly risen.
