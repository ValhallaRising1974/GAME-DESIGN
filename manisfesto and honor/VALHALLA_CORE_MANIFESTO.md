### ✨ Vision
Valhalla Rising – The Parchment is not just a MOBA. It is a sacred competitive environment where **fun, honor, cooperation, and emotional growth** coexist. We aim to change how people play, relate, and grow through games.

---

### 🧭 Core Objectives
- Foster a welcoming competitive environment focused on **joy, mutual growth, and strategic integrity**.
- Discourage **toxicity** and penalize offensive behavior.
- Promote **collaboration and healthy communication** in every match.
- Reward **empathy, teamwork, and leadership** beyond kill counts.
- Embed honor into champion dialogues, interactions, and world narrative.
- Reinforce emotional development through match experiences.
- Ensure **losses contribute to growth**, not shame.

### 🤝 Honor System (Design Summary)
Players can gain or lose **honor points** based on behavior:

| Behavior                      | Honor Points |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Encouraging an ally          | +2           |
| Showing respect to opponents | +1           |
| Toxic or abusive chat        | -3           |
| Team griefing or sabotage    | -5           |
| Uplifting the team after loss| +3           |

### 🗣️ Champion Reactions
Champion dialogue is tied to the player's in-game behavior:

```python
champion_lines = {
    "Rayzel": {
        "on_honor_gained": "Let the strength of spirit lead more than the swing of your blade.",
        "on_toxic_behavior": "Victory means nothing if earned without dignity."
    },
    "Yara": {
        "on_honor_gained": "You watered someone’s hope today. That is a rare gift.",
        "on_toxic_behavior": "Even the earth recoils at cruel words."
    },
    "Seth": {
        "on_honor_gained": "Justice without cruelty. You chose wisely.",
        "on_toxic_behavior": "Be careful. Darkness can start with a whisper."
    }
}
```
