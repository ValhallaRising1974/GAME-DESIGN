# 🗺️ Concept Map – Valhalla Rising: The Parchment

This image represents the early stages of the official map for the MOBA **Valhalla Rising – The Parchment**, artistically conceived by the author Marcelo dos Santos Prado. This pencil sketch is a conceptual draft outlining the initial geography of the arena, including strategic paths, vegetation, and battleground terrain.

More than a drawing, this map is the visual foundation of a world at war — divided by symbolic lanes and contested zones that will embody the game’s tactical essence. The artwork captures the embryonic phase of development, where creative intuition and hand-drawn lines begin shaping the playable universe.

This sketch will later be transformed into a finalized painting — an ink-and-watercolor artwork on 300g cotton paper — by the talented artist and art professor **Thais Mengato**, who will bring the battlefield to life with refined technique and deep sensitivity, while honoring the original creative vision.

This README is a tribute to the first visual steps of Valhalla Rising’s development — where blank paper becomes a battleground, and dreams are drawn, line by line.
