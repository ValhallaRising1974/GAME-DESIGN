# üó∫Ô∏è Valhalla Rising ‚Äì Symbolic Map (Java Prototype)

This Java-based map system is part of the evolving game universe **Valhalla Rising ‚Äì The Parchment**. It represents a simplified version of the battlefield, including key symbolic elements like routes and obelisks.

## Overview

The map is divided into three main lanes where champions move, interact, and clash:

- **Highland** ‚Äì The top route
- **The Middle Way** ‚Äì The central lane
- **Firestarter** ‚Äì The bottom route

Each lane includes **Obelisks**, spiritual and strategic anchors within the game world.
