# üó∫Ô∏è Valhalla Rising ‚Äì Symbolic Map (Python Prototype)

This is a prototype map system for **Valhalla Rising ‚Äì The Parchment**, developed in Python. 
It represents the game's symbolic battlefield using characters and grid logic.

---

## Overview

The map is a floating battlefield, shaped by ancient forces. It is divided into three key routes:

- **Highland** (Top Lane)
- **The Middle Way** (Mid Lane)
- **Firestarter** (Bottom Lane)

Each lane contains **Obelisks**, ancient structures of defense and symbolism. The terrain floats in a void, surrounded by the stars.

---

## Current Features

- Map grid: 13 columns x 9 rows
- Symbolic representation of lanes and obelisks
- Printed layout in the terminal
- Expandable logic for movement, fog of war, and collision in future versions
