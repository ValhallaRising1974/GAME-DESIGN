 Prototyping Module ‚Äì Valhalla Python Tools

This folder contains experimental scripts and algorithm prototypes for the universe of Valhalla Rising ‚Äì The Parchment.
These scripts are created in Python and serve as a symbolic and technical bridge for simulating gameplay mechanics, character balancing, and mystical systems.

Structure and Purpose

Each script in this folder is designed to test a core idea before it's implemented in the main game engine. These ideas often emerge from symbolic logic, mythological tension, and gameplay flow.

Why Prototyping Matters

‚ÄúPrototyping is the sacred forge where ideas are tested before becoming legend.‚Äù

This module allows for:

Quick iterations on combat formulas

Lore-inspired statistical analysis

Emergent behavior exploration (without engine constraints)

Notes for Contributors

Keep all scripts modular and well-documented

Use placeholder values with symbolic meaning (essences, classes, etc.)

When a prototype stabilizes, it can be migrated to the main combat core or engine logic
