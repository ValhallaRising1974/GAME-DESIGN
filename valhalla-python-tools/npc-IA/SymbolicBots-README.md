NPC AI ‚Äì Symbolic Intelligence Module

This folder contains the early development of the Symbolic AI System for non-player characters (NPCs) in Valhalla Rising ‚Äì The Parchment. Unlike traditional bots based solely on logic or damage output, these NPCs are guided by essences, emotions, and environmental symbolism.

Core Concept

Each bot is created as a SymbolicBot, containing:

A Name and Essence (e.g., Doubt, Fury, Harmony)

Emotional states like Aggression and Caution

Adaptive behaviors influenced by:

Cosmic energy levels

Number of enemies nearby

Presence or absence of map fog (symbol of uncertainty)

These bots simulate living entities within a mystical, mythological map. Their choices represent more than survival‚Äîthey echo their inner conflict.

Vision

This system is part of the broader mission of Valhalla Rising: to build a universe where game mechanics and symbolic storytelling merge. NPCs are not cannon fodder ‚Äî they are sentient fragments of the world‚Äôs pulse.
